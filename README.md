# Flowers-image-detection
## To create a model which predicts the flowers name using their image.

In this module, the flower image detection system is created using the libraries keras,Tensorflow and OpenCV.
First, the dataset is loaded and different folder is created for each flower categories and the available flower images are saved in the respective folder. Then the dataset is splitted into 3 parts namely train,validation and test sets. The model is trained using function ResNet50 and then a user defined function created using OpenCV to build the model and predict the flower image from the inputed image.
